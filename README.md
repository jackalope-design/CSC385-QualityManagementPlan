# Quality Management Plan

Made for the class: **CSC 485 - Quality Assurance**

This is a full QA analasiss report of a prodject I did for my datastructures class. Me and my groupmates focused on: Testcases, Boundary Value Analsys, Controll and Dataflow, C-use and P-use, Object Orintation testing, State testing, Loop coverage, equivalance classes, and Polymorphism tests.
