# Quality Management Plan

Made for the class: **CSC 485 - Quality Assurance**

This is a full QA analysis report of a project I did for my data structures class. Me and my groupmates focused on: Test Cases, Boundary Value Analysis, Control and Dataflow, C-use and P-use, Object Orientation testing, State testing, Loop coverage, equivalence classes, and Polymorphism tests.
